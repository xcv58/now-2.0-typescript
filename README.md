# Now + TypeScript

> ðŸš€ This is deployed with [Now 2](https://zeit.co/now). Please feel free to enjoy the [live demo](https://typescript-sushi.now.sh).

This example, a sushi information application, uses TypeScript and shares a type definition across frontend and backend in this [majestic monorepo](https://zeit.co/blog/now-2#the-majestic-monorepo).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd now-examples/typescript`
3. `yarn` (optionally `npm i`)
4. `yarn dev src/frontend/index.ts` to run the front page lambda locally, or
   - `yarn dev src/frontend/sushi.ts` to run the sushi detail lambda locally, or
   - `yarn dev path/to/ts/lambda.ts` to run a TS Lambda locally.

## More Info

We have written [a comprehensive blog post](https://zeit.co/blog/scalable-apps-with-typescript-and-now-2) that highlights the code in this project in detail. We recommend having a look at it.
